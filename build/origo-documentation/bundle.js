For more information about Origo and how to download please visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/origo-map/origo). If you are a new user of Origo it is recommended to take a look at the basic examples that are included on GitHub.\n\nAn origo map can be created once its JavaScript and CSS file is included on a page. How the map is created is explained in [Creating the map](#creating-the-map). All available settings and options are described and examplified in this documentation.\n\n## Creating the map\n\nThe map is typically initialized with a json configuration as in the example to the right. As an alternative the json object can be included directly instead of a path to a json file. A third alternative is to initialize a map with an url to another origo map. The url is created with the share control. This is for example useful when you want to embed a map. If the map-parameter is set in the url (eg http://origoMapUrl/#map=anotherconfig ), then the map configuration will be ignored and anotherconfig.json will be loaded.\n\nThe configuration file must strictly follow the JSON standard (https://www.json.org/) with the addition of javascript style _one line comments_ and _block comments_.\n\nThe code for initiating Origo should always be inserted somewhere within the `<body>` tag and not within the `<head>` tag.\n\n```javascript\n// This is a comment to the end of this line.\n{ name: \'scaleline\' }, // It does not have to start at the beginning of a line\n/* This is a comment until the end of comment marker.\n   It can span several lines but not be nested */\n```\n\nProperty | Description\n---|---\n`map configuration` | json path, json or an origo url with the map configuration\n`options` | optional configuration that is set before the map configuration is read.\n\nOption | Description\n---|---\n`crossDomain` | option to allow cross origin request of map configuration. Default is true.\n`target` | element id of the container for the map. Default is \'#app-wrapper\'.\n`baseUrl` | baseUrl for the root url that is used to request map resouces with relative paths. If not provided the baseUrl is set when the map is initialized.\n`authorizationUrl` | an url that triggers authorization. It can for example be used to send a wms request that will trigger authorization before the map is loaded.\n`svgSpritePath` | path for svg sprites. Default is \'css/svg/\'.\n`svgSprites` | list of svg sprites that should be requested.\n`breakPoints` | breakpoints determining what is shown at different screen sizes.\n`breakPointsPrefix` | prefix to use when styling with breakpoints. Defaults to o-media.\n`defaultControls` | to override loading of default controls (scaleline, zoom, rotate, attribution and fullscreen).\n`mapState` | mapState-object to override settings in the json-config.\n`controls` | dictionary of third-party controls that may be configured.\n\n#### Example map with json\n\n```javascript\n<script type="text/javascript">\n  var origo = Origo(\'index.json\');\n<\/script>\n```\n\n\n#### Example map with origo url\n\n```javascript\n<script type="text/javascript">\n  var origo = Origo(\'http://www.malardalskartan.se/app/#layers=topowebbkartan_nedtonad/v/1/s/0,vasteras/v/1/s/0,samhalls_projekt/v/1/s/0&center=172605,6596280&zoom=2&pin=348078,6686310&map=malardalskartan\');\n<\/script>\n```\n\n#### Example map with options\n\n```javascript\n<script type="text/javascript">\n  var origo = Origo(\'index.json\', {\n    target: \'#the-map,\n    breakPoints: {\n      xs: [240, 320],\n      s: [320, 320],\n      m: [500, 500],\n      l: [768, 500]\n    },\n    breakPointsPrefix: \'o-media\',\n    defaultControls: [\n      { name: \'scaleline\' },\n      { name: \'zoom\' },\n      { name: \'rotate\' },\n      { name: \'attribution\' },\n      { name: \'fullscreen\' }\n    ],\n    mapState: {\n      "layers": [\n        "osm/v/1/s/0/o/100",\n        "origo-mask/v/1/s/0/o/25",\n        "origo-cities/v/1/s/0/o/100"\n      ],\n      "center": "1810000,8390000",\n      "zoom": "8.7",\n      "legend": "expanded",\n      "map": "index"\n    }\n  });\n<\/script>\n```\n\n## Dynamic configuration of third-party controls\n\nOrigo comes with many built-in controls, however there also exist many useful third-party plugins, distributed as plugins. They can be instantiated manually, however you also have to option to let Origo instantiate them, in which case they can also be configured by the `controls` section in the normal configuration file.\n\nThis has two primary advantages over manually instantiating plugins:\n\n* All configuration in one place\n* Re-use the same HTML & JavaScript files for different map configurations, including different sets of controls\n\nSynchronous loading requires the control factory function to be available in the instantiating scope. This can be achived by adding a `<script>` tag for the plugin, or by importing it using `ESM` (`import ... from ...`) or `CommonJS` (`const ... = require(...)`) syntax.\n\nFor asynchronous loading using a bundler is strongly recommended, as it simplifies the required loading code. Note that asynchronous loading requires the plugin to `export` the control factory function, the examples shown assume that the function is the default export. This is not the case for some published plugins, which can be solved by adding `export default FUNCTION;` at the end of the minified plugin file (where `FUNCTION` is the name of the control factory function).\n\nIn general, asynchronous loading is recommended especially for plugins that are large or infrequently used.\n\n#### Example of synchronously loaded plugin control\n\n```javascript\nvar origo = Origo(\'index.json\', {\n controls: {\n   lmsearch: Lmsearch,\n }\n});\n```\n\n#### Example of asynchronously loaded plugin control (using Vite)\n\n```javascript\nvar origo = Origo(\'index.json\', {\n controls: {\n   swiper: async () => (await import("swiper-plugin")).default,\n }\n});\n```\n\n\n#### Example of asynchronously loaded plugin control (without bundler)\n\n```javascript\nvar origo = Origo(\'index.json\', {\n controls: {\n   swiper: async () => (await import("./plugins/swiper/swiper.min.js")).default,\n }\n});\n```\n\n# Settings\n## Basic settings\n\nBasic settings for the application include map options such as projection and extent. Note that all OpenLayers map and view settings of string, number or boolean type (or arrays/objects thereof) can be set in the config file, on the first level.

This name is used by layers to reference the source.\n\nThe options that are available for a source depends on the type of layer and is described under each layer type.\n\n\n\n#### Example defining sources\n\n```json\n{\n  "source": {\n    "local_wms": {\n      "url": "http://localhost/geoserver/origo/wms"\n    },\n    "local_wmts": {\n      "url": "http://localhost/geowebcache/service/wmts"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Attributes\n\nBy default all available attributes for a queryable layer are listed in a featureinfo popup. The content can be customized in several ways, for example to make url:s or embed images. There are two basic approaches to do this. The first is to use a named handlebars template. This is what is used by default but requires a precompiled template. The second approach is to define how each attribute should be presented in the layer configuration. Each attribute is defined within curly brackets with options according the table below.\n\n### Information window\n\nAttribute options | Description\n---|---\n`name` | the name of the attribute. The value of the attribute will be shown. Optional.\n`title` | static label for the attribute. Optional.\n`url` | absolute url (\'//example.com/nonsense.html\') or attribute containing an url. Creates a link automatically and can be combined with name as value. Optional.\n`urlPrefix` | a general prefix to be used together with url, img, audio or video. Optional.\n`urlSuffix` | a general suffix to be used together with url, img, audio or video. Optional.\n`target` | default behaviour is to open url in new window (_blank). It\'s possible to specify other targets as _top, _self and _parent or to open link in an iframe in a modal window which should than be set to modal for normal size or modal-full. Optional.\n`targetTitle` | used along with target to define title in modal titlebar and link tooltip. Can be set to "static text" or "{{attribute value}}". Default is url.\n`img` | attribute containing url or base64 data to an image. The image will be embedded. Optional.\n`audio` | attribute containing url or base64 data to an audio file. The audio will be embedded. Optional.\n`video` | attribute containing url or base64 data to an video file. The video will be embedded. Optional.\n`carousel` | attribute containing url to several images combined with splitter option. Set `autoplay` in `featureinfoOptions` to have the carousel rotate the images. Optional.\n`splitter` | set a splitter for example , or ; which is used to split the attribute if it is made up of delimited list of compounded attributes of the same type. To be used together with `url`, `img`, `audio`, `video`, `carousel` and `linktext`. Optional.\n`cls` | css class name for custom styling. Optional.\n`html` | Custom html. Attributes can be referenced by placing the attribute name within double curly brackets.  It also possible in a similar way to apply a function by prepending the function name with `@`. See table below for supported functions. The `html` option can\'t be combined with any of the other options, except for `cls`. Optional.\n`linktext` | Name of attribute that holds the text that should be used on links when using `url` in combination with `splitter`. Optional.\n`prefix` | adds the text entered in front of the attribute value. Optional.\n`suffix` | adds the text entered after the attribute value. Optional.\n`formatDatetime` | makes it possible to format an attribute that contains a datetime value that follows ISO 8601 or Unix TimeStamp. FormatDatetime value should be a object specifying which locale to be used for the formatting and an options object with choosen formats, for example `{"locale": "sv-SE", "options": { "dateStyle": "full", "timeStyle": "long" }}` if you want swedish formatting with ful date and long time reprsentation or `{"locale": "en-US", "options": { "weekday": "long", "year": "numeric", "month": "long", "day": "numeric" }}` if you want american english, weekday and month as word and year and day as numbers. More formatting options can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat The default value is `{"locale": "default", "options": { dateStyle: \'full\', timeStyle: \'long\' }}`. Optional.\n\n**Html Attribute Functions**\n\nAn html attribute function is either used with no arguments (all defaults) or all arguments specifed enclosed by parenthesis and separated by comma. Arguments are specified as constant values without any form of quotation marks.\n\nFunction name | Description | Arguments | Example\n---|---|---|---\n`@center` | Prints out the center coordinate of the geometry | coordinatesystem: _string_ (defaults to map coordsys), axis rotation: `default` \\|\\| `reverse` (defaults to `default`) | `{{@center(EPSG:4326,reverse)}}`\n`@area` | Prints out the area of the geometry.

Length is automatically scaled to a suitable unit (m,km) | decimals: _integer_ (defaults to 2) | `{{@length(1)}}`\n\n\n#### Example defining layer attributes\n\n```json\n{\n  "name": "mygeojson",\n  "title": "My geojson with custom attributes",\n  "source": "data/mylayer.geojson",\n  "style": "mask",\n  "type": "GEOJSON",\n  "attributes": [\n    {\n      "name":"NAME",\n      "title": "Name: ",\n      "url": "PAGEID",\n      "urlPrefix":"http://my.link.com/",\n      "urlSuffix":".html"\n    },\n    {\n      "html": "<p>For more information contact {{CONTACT}} at {{PHONE}}</p>",\n      "cls": "o-custom-class-name"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### Editor attributes\n\nWhen editing a layer, additional attributes are supported to control the behaviour of the edit attributes tool.\n\nAttribute option | Description\n---|---\n`type` | The attribute type. Determines which edit control is used. See [Editor attribute types](#editor-attribute-types)  (required)\n`allowBatchEdit` | _bool_ true if allowed to update a selection of features with the same value (optional)\n`config`| _object_ Additional configuration. The config object depends on the _type_.\n`constraint` | _string_  \\<event\\>:\\<attribute name\\>:\\<value\\> or \\<event\\>:\\<attribute name\\>:[\\<value1\\>,\\<value2\\>, ...], where \\<event\\> is the event that the \\<attribute name\\> input emits, most likely `change`. Attribute is only editable when \\<attribute name\\> has value \\<value\\> (optional)\n`list` | _array of strings_ or _array of list object_. List of possible values for searchList. (optional)\n`maxLength` | _int_ Maximum number of characters (optional)\n`options` | _array of strings_ List of allowed values. Required for type `dropdown` (optional)\n`readonly` | _bool_ True if attribute should be displayed but not allowed to edit (optional)\n`required` | _bool_ True if the attribut must have a value (optional)\n`defaultValue` | _string_ or _object_. When type is string that string is used as default value on feature creation. When it is an object a _defaultValue_ object defines behaviour (optional)\n\n\n**Editor attribute types**\n\ntype | format | required | readonly | maxLength | constraint | Description\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n`text`      | string | supported | supported | supported || Text input\n`textarea`  | string | supported | supported | supported || Text input with resizable box\n`dropdown`  | string || supported || supported | Dropdown based on options values\n`checkbox`  | boolean or configured values || supported ||| Checkbox, defaults not checked.\n`checkboxgroup`  | array with configured values || supported ||| A group of checkboxes where multiple choices can be selected and also freetext choices can be added, defaults to not checked.\n`image`     | base64 || supported ||| Uploads image\n`audio`     | base64 or url || supported ||| Uploads audio or sets url to audio\n`video`     | base64 or url || supported ||| Uploads video or sets url to video\n`color`     | hexadecimal || supported ||| Activates a color-picker\n`time`      | hh:mm:ss | supported | supported ||| Defaults to current time. Use defaultTime:false to not.\n`date`      | YYYY-MM-DD | supported | supported ||| Defaults to current date. Use defaultDate:false to not.\n`datetime`  | YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss | supported | supported ||| Defaults to current date. Use defaultDatetime:false to not.\n`email`     | string | supported | supported ||| Email address\n`url`       | string | supported | supported ||| Homepage address\n`integer`   | integer | supported | supported ||| Whole number\n`decimal`   | decimal | supported | supported ||| Decimal number\n`searchList`   | string | supported ||supported. Defaults to 50|| Dropdown based on options values with search capabilities. \n`hidden` | string ||||| Not visible to the user.\n\n**searchList List object**\n\nDefines the possible values in a _searchList_\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`value` | _string_ text to display. If `useBackingValue` is set it is used as the value while `label` is used for display | When _location_ is not specified | \n`src`| _url_ to an image that will be displayed next to _value_. Url is relative to app or absolute | No |\n`location`| _url_ to a HTML page that contains links to images. All a-tags hrefs that matches _extension_ will be used as list items. Filename will appear as text and the image itself as a thumbnail next to the text. If _location_ is specified it must be only item in list | No |\n`extension` | Filename extension without dot to filter links when using _location_ | When _location_ is specified |\n`label`| Text to display and search instead of value when `useBackingValue` is set | When `useBackingValue` is _true_ | \n\n**searchList Config object**\nAn object that defines additional configuration for searchList. The searchList can be configured to get its list from static configuration\nor a remote server. If using a remote server it can either get all available options in one request or\nquery the server for each keypress. It can also be configured to use _value_ and _label_ similar to an HTML select drop down. In that\ncase _value_ is stored in the database but _label_ is displayed in the searchList.\n\n__Requirerments on the backend server__\nIf the `url` option is used an additional HTTP server endpoint is needed, not included in the origo project.\nThe server must respond with a list of _searchList list objects_ as described above with the exception that `location` is not supported. There is no support for authentication other than what the browser\nautomatically provides, e.g. sending cookies or authentication headers if server is located on same site as application. \n\n\nIf the `dynamic` option is used the server must accept a GET parameter named "input" or the configured `queryParameter` name. The parameter gets the value of the searchList text box and the server should return\na list of matching search items. The exact algorithm is up to the server, but origo will assume the list is filtered and sorted so the list will be displayed as is as suggestions, but will be truncated to `maxItems`. If the server\'s algorithm is not based on substrings of the value, the highlighting may not work as expected.\n\nIf the `useBackingValue` is specified in combination with `dynamic` the server must besides return both _value_ and _label_ for each list item also support reverse looking up in order to display correct label for the current value\nwhen opening the attribute editor. The reverse lookup is performed by sending the current value as GET parameter "value". The surver must\nthen respond with a list with exactly one _searchList list objects_ with both _value_ and _label_ that corresponds to the current value.\n\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`url`| Url (GET) that responds with a JSON _array of List object_ (_location_ not supported) or _array of string_. If specified, _list_ property is ignored. | No  |\n`dynamic` | _true_ if the server specified in `url` should be queried for each keypress. | No | false\n`queryParameter` | Name of query parameter to use to send user input to `url` when `dynamic` is _true_| No | "input"\n`allowOnlyFromList` | _true_ if the user only can input values from the list, which makes it work like a searchable drop down. | No | _false_\n`disallowDropDown` | _true_ to allow the user to click the down arrow (or enter) when input is empty and get all possible suggestions even if minChar has not been reached. | No | _false_ \n`minChars` | Number of character that must be written before suggestions are displayed. | No | 2\n`maxItems`| Number of suggestion items to display | No | 10\n`typeMoreText` | The text to show to the user if the input has less then _minChar_ characters. | No | "Skriv fler tecken"\n`noHitsText` | The text to show to the user if there are no suggestions to show. | No | "Inga träffar"\n`useBackingValue` | If set to _true_ the list items must have both `value` and `label`. `value` is stored in the database and `label`is displayed in the searchList. If used in combination with `dynamic=true`, the server must also support reverse lookup as described in the requirements on the backend server. | No | _false_,\n`valueQueryParameter`| When using `useBackingValue` in combination with `dynamic` the GET parameter name that is used for reverse lookup can be set using this parameter | No | "value"\n\n**defaultValue object**\n\nThe defaultValue object controls how an attribute\'s default value is handled. Default values are always set when creating new features, and can optionally be set when updating attributes.\nDefault values can be overridden in the attribute editor unless attribute is configured as readonly or hidden.\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`type` | Source of default value. One of `sessionStorage`, `localStorage`, `timestamp`. If `timestamp` is specified it overrules default values for input types `time`, `date` and `datetime` | Yes | \n`key`| key in sessionStorage or localStorgage | When `type` is `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` |\n`updateOnEdit`| `true` if default value should be applied when editing as well as creating a new feature. | No | `false`\n`timeStampFormat`| One of `time` = "HH:mm:ss", `date`= "yyyy-MM-dd", `datetime` = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss", `timestamp` = "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss | No | `timestamp`\n`useUTC` | `true`if time should be in UTC, otherwise local time | No | `false`\n\n**checkbox Config object**\n\nAn object that defines additional configuration for checkbox. The entire object is optional and all\nproperties are set to default if omitted.\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n `uncheckedValue` | Value that corresponds to the unchecked state | No | 0 (false)\n `checkedValue` | Value that corresponds to the checked state | No | 1 (true)\n\n**checkboxgroup additional attributes**\n\nAttribute option | Description | Note | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`options` | An array of objects further explained in next section | This shares the name with `dropdown` but not the syntax. Required for type `checkboxgroup` | Defaults to `[]`.\n`separator` | The separator to be used to differentiate the values. | This effects the way the value is saved so changes in config will need updating the data values correspondingly. | Defaults to `;`.\n`freetextOptionPrefix` | The prefix text in the value to be uesd to differentiate that this is a freetext value. | This effects the way the value is saved so changes in config will need updating the data values correspondingly. | Defaults to `freetext_option:`.\n`freetextOptionValueSeparator`| The sign used to differentiate the unique freetext option and it\'s value. | This effects the way the value is saved so changes in config will need updating the data values correspondingly. | Defaults to `=`.\n\n**checkboxgroup options array syntax**\n\nFor the checkboxgroup attribute type an array can be supplied used to set up multiple choice type checkbox questions.\nThe array should at least contain one object with the key `text` and a string value.\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`text` | The text for the choice and will also be the value unless another is specified | Yes |\n`value` | Optional the object can have the key `value` which holds an alternative value for the option. | No | Defaults to the `text` if not supplied.\n`type` | By adding to the object the type `textbox`, a textbox is attached to the option, the text box is enabled only if the option is checked. This can be used as an "other"/"miscellaneous" free text option. | No |\n\n#### Example editor attributes\n\n```json\n\n{\n  "name": "art",\n  "title": "Art: ",\n  "type": "text",\n  "maxLength": 64,\n  "readonly": true,\n},\n{\n  "name": "isTrue",\n  "title": "Is this true?: ",\n  "type": "checkbox",\n  "config": {\n      "checkedValue": "true",\n      "uncheckedValue": "false"\n  }  \n},\n{\n  "name": "multiChoice",\n  "title": "Please select all that applies: ",\n  "type": "checkboxgroup",\n  "options":  [\n      { "text": "choice 1" },\n      { "text": "choice 2", "value": 2 },\n      { "text": "choice 3" },\n      { "text": "choice other", "type": "textbox" }\n  ]\n},\n{\n  "name": "category",\n  "title": "category: ",\n  "type": "dropdown",\n  "options": [\n      "category_1",\n      "category_2",\n      "category_3"\n  ]\n},\n{\n  "name": "subcategory",\n  "title": "subcategory: ",\n  "type": "dropdown",\n  "constraint": "change:category:category_1",\n  "options": [\n      "subcategory_1",\n      "subcategory_2",\n      "subcategory_3"\n  ]\n},\n{\n  "name": "choice",\n  "title": "choice: ",\n  "type": "dropdown",\n  "options": [\n      "choice 1",\n      "choice 2",\n      "choice 3"\n  ]\n},\n{\n  "name": "subchoice",\n  "title": "subchoice: ",\n  "type": "dropdown",\n  "constraint": "change:choice:[choice 1,choice 3]",\n  "options": [\n      "subchoice 1",\n      "subchoice 2",\n      "subchoice 3"\n  ]\n},\n{\n  "name": "sprak",\n  "title": "Språk: ",\n  "type": "searchList",\n  "list": [\n      {\n        "value": "Java"\n      },\n      ...\n  ],\n  "config": {\n    "minChars": 2,\n    "maxItems": 15\n  }\n},\n{\n  "name": "icons",\n  "title": "Ikoner: ",\n  "type": "searchList",\n  "list": [\n    {\n      "src": "img/kompass.svg",\n      "value": "Riktning"\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  "config": {\n    "minChars": 0,\n    "maxItems": 5\n  }\n},\n{\n  "name": "icon-lib",\n  "title": "Bibliotek: ",\n  "type": "searchList",\n  "list": [\n    {\n      "location": "img/png",\n      "extension": "png"\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  "config": {\n    "minChars": 0,\n    "maxItems": 5\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Example Default Values.

An attachment is typically an\nimage or document that relates to a special feature and for practical reasons can not be stored in an attribute.\nAttachments can be viewed, added and removed by the user in the editor form and viewed in featureInfo as links or emedded as images.\n\nAttachments are configured on each layer. It can be configured\nfor both raster and vector layers, but can only be edited on vector layers.\nIn order to use attachments, an attachment server is needed. The attachment server must implement the arcgis server\nrest api for attachments.\n\n- _attachment Infos_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/attachment-infos-feature-service-.htm\n- _attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/attachment-feature-service-.htm\n- _add attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/add-attachment.htm\n- _delete attachment_ https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/delete-attachments.htm\n\n\nOptionally the server can extend the AGS interface by adding the concept\nof attachment groups in order to group attachments in different groups. Groups can be used to have\ndifferent rules and display them differently. AGS server can be used out-of-the-box for AGS layers, but the extented\nformat must be implemented as a server side component.\n\nThe extensions to the AGS format are:\n\n- The response from _attachments infos_ must include a "group" property for each attachmentInfo object\n- The request to _addAttachment_ must include a "group" parameter\n\nA reference implementation of the extended\nformat is available here: https://github.com/ornskoldsvikskommun/attachmentServer-reference It\nshould not be used for production environments as it lacks security, performance and\nflexibilty.\n\n### Attachment configuration\nAttachments are configured on each layer using the `"attachments"` property containing an object with the following properties.\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`url` | The base adress for the attachment server. | Yes\n`formTitle` | Title of section in editor form | No | \'Bilagor\'\n`format` | The format to use. \'origo\' or \'arcgis\'. \'origo\' extenteds the AGS format by using groups | No | \'origo\'\n`foreignKey` | Name of the attribute in the parent feature that contains the private key. | No | Uses id of feature\n`stripLayerNameFromId` | Removes layer name from featureid when _foreignKey_ is not specified. Useful when using geoserver wfs services to get only database FID as private key. | No | _true_\n`layerId` | The layer id in the attachment server. | No | _Layer name_\n`groups` | Array of [group objects](#Group-object) defining an attachment group. A group has its own title and each group is treated as a separate attribute. At least one group has to be specified. If format is "arcgis" exactly one group must be specified | Yes |\n\n\n### Group object\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`name` | Name of the group on the attachment server. Ignored for format \'arcgis\' | Yes |\n`title` | Title displayed in the editor. Ignored for format \'arcgis\' | No | `name`\n`linkAttribute` | Name of an attribute to create on a feature containing all links as a semicolon separated list. Can be used to create links in featureInfo using the _img_ or _url_ property. | No |\n`fileNameAttribute` | Name of an attribute to create on a feature containing all filename as a semicolon separated list. Order is same as linkAttribute list. Can be used in combination with _linkAttribute_ to set link text using the _linktext_ property | No\n`allowedFiles` | Comma separated list of valid file extensions and mime types that are allowed to upload. Format is accordning to the accept attribute of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file | No | *\n\n#### Example attachment configuration\n```json\n"attachments": {\n        "formTitle" : "Attachments",\n        "layerId": "entity_blob",\n        "url": "http://gis.kommun.org/attachmentserver/",\n        "groups": [\n          {\n            "name": "proto",\n            "title": "Protocols",\n            "allowedFiles": ".pdf"\n          },\n          {\n            "name": "public",\n            "title": "Public Image",\n            "allowedFiles": ".jpg,.png",\n            "linkAttribute": "pictureLinks",\n            "fileNameAttribute": "pictureTexts"\n\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n```\n\n#### Example display attachments in featureinfo configuration\n```json\n"attributes": [\n    {\n        "title": "Images",\n        "linktext": "pictureTexts",\n        "url": "pictureLinks",\n        "splitter": ";"\n     }\n]\n```\n\n## Related Layers\nA related layer is a layer that is a child in a _1-to-many_ relationship. Origo supports related layers for WFS layers by\ndefining a _private-foreign key relation_ between layers. The layers do not have to be in the same database or be servered from\nthe same WFS server. The relation is only stored in the child object, which makes it suitable for adding attributes\nto a table that is considered read only.\nA layer can have several child layers and a child layer can have child layers of its own.\n\nEntries in the child layer can be added, deleted and edited through the parent\'s edit form and does not have a geometry of its own. Child objects may have a geometry,\nbut there is not support to edit or add new geometries other that edit the child layer directly.\n\nAttributes from child layers can be aggregated and displayed in the featureInfo window of the parent.\n\n### Related layers Configuration\nAll configuration regarding the relation is performed on the parent layer. The child layer must be configured as an ordinary wfs layer and most likely configured with\n`\'isTable\': true`. The child layer can use `\'strategy\': \'bbox\'` even if it is a table. In that case related objects are fetched when the parent is edited or featureInfo\nis displayed\n\nRelations are configured on the parent layer using the `"relatedLayers"` property containing an array of objects with the following properties.\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`layerName` | Name of the child layer as already configured as a layer | Yes |\n`PK`| Name of the field that holds the private key in the parent object. | No | featureid (omit for featureid as that can not be explicitly set)\n`stripPK` | If PK is featureid, remove layer name part from featureid when joining. Useful to keep only the fid part as FK in the database. | No | true\n`FK` | Name of field in child that holds the foreign key. When a new entry is created this field will be updated with the value of PK of the parent. | Yes |\n`FKIsString` | Has to be `true` if the FK field datatype in database is string. | No | false\n`childTitle`| The title (string) that will be displayed above all child elements in the parent\'s attributes editor | No | Child layer\'s `title`\n`featureTitle`| Name of the attribute that holds the text that will be displayed in the parent\'s attribute form for each feature | No | featureid\n`maxChildren`| Number of children that can be added. | No | Unlimited\n`cascadingDelete`| How to handle if parent is deleted. Can be one of `\'cascade\'` : delete recursively, both in database and in local layer. `\'db\'`: Assume database has cascading delete and only recursively delete locally. `\'none\'`:  Do nothing. Child remains both locally and in db, orphaned | No | `\'none\'`\n`disableAdd` | `true` if the add button in the parent\'s edit form should be disabled for this layer| No | false\n`disableDelete` | `true` if the delete button in the parent\'s edit form should be disabled for this layer | No | false\n`disableEdit` | `true` if the edit button in the parent\'s edit form should be disabled for this layer | No | false\n`promoteAttribs`| An array of [promoteAttrib objects](#promoteAttrib-object) that defines how attributes are aggregated and available to the parent in featureInfo | No | None\n\n\n### promoteAttrib object\n\nEach entry creates an attribute on the parent by first extract an expression from each child and then aggregate the\nresult from all children. Currently the only supported aggregation function is _string.join()_\n\nProperty | Description | Required | Default value\n---|---|---|---\n`parentName` | Name of the attribute to create in the parent | Yes |\n`html` | Template string that extracts values from each child object. Attribute names enclosed in `{{}}` are replaced with its value. Does not have to be html, but can contain html tags | Yes\n`separator` | String to use as separator when aggregating extracted strings | No | Empty string\n\n#### Example related tables configuration\nBasic example to set up a parent which has a related child layer. The parent itself is not editable, but the child layer has two attributes that can be edited. Also\nthe attributes from the child layer is aggregated and displayed in the featureInfo window of the parent.\n\n```json\n{\n  "layers": [\n    {\n      // This is the child layer\n      "name": "sf:person",\n      "source": "local_wfs",\n      "type": "WFS",\n      "isTable": true,\n      "attributes": [\n        {\n          "name": "name",\n          "type": "text"\n        },\n        {\n          "name": "org",\n          "type": "text"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      // This is the parent layer\n      "name": "sf:property",\n      "queryable": true,\n      "group": "root",\n      "source": "local_wfs",\n      "type": "WFS",\n      "geometryName": "the_geom",\n      "geometryType": "Point",\n      "visible": true,\n      "editable": true,\n      "allowedEditOperations": [\n        "updateAttributes"\n      ],\n      "attributes": [\n        {\n          "name": "adress",\n          "type": "text",\n          "readonly": true\n        },\n        {\n          // This is the temporary attribute created by related table configuration\n          "name": "responsible",\n        }\n      ],\n      "relatedLayers": [\n        {\n          "layerName": "person",\n          "FK": "parent_fid",\n          "featureTitle": "name",\n          "promoteAttribs": [\n            {\n              "parentName": "responsible",\n              "html": "<p><b>{{name}},</b>{{org}}</p>"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n## Automatic default (legend) style for WMS layers\nA WMS layer can have a style property defined for its legend graphic or for an alternate layer style defined on the WMS server. If a style property is not defined then Origo will attempt to create one for the legend graphic using getLegendGraphic and optionally two additional layer properties can then be defined, `legendParams` and `hasThemeLegend`.  \n\n`hasThemeLegend` is used to manually indicate if the layer has theme symbology and that the legend should be behind a theme style icon (extendedLegend).\n\nExample `legendParams` object with Geoserver vendor parameter\n```json\n      "legendParams" : {\n        "scale" : 5000,\n        "legend_options" : "dpi:300"\n      }\n```\n## stylePicker\nThe stylePicker is available for vector layers and WMS layers. It is defined in one way for vector layers and a slightly different way for WMS layers due to the different nature of styles of image type layers like WMS layers compared to the client side styles of vector layers.\n#### vector layers\nA stylePicker refers to defined styles and allows a style title to be set. (It usually makes sens for the `style` property of the layer to refer to one of the styles in the stylePicker.)\n```json\n"stylePicker": [\n  {"title": "Sommarstil", "style": "bokbuss_sommar"},\n  {"title": "Sval ton", "style": "bokbuss_bla"}\n]\n///\n"styles": {\n  "bokbuss_sommar": [\n    [\n      {\n        "stroke": {\n          "color": "rgba(211,84,0,1.0)"\n        },\n        "fill": {\n          "color": "rgba(241,196,15,0.9)"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n#### WMS layers\nif a stylePicker is defined for a WMS layer then it refers to styles available to the layer on the WMS server. \n\nA `style` layer property is overriden and any `hasThemeLegend` and `legendParams` are incorporated in the stylePicker on a per layer basis (rather than as properties of the layer). \n\nThere can only be one `defaultWMSServerStyle` as well as `initialStyle` where the later specifies which style the map should load with. If there\'s no `initialStyle` specified then the first style in the array will be it.\n```json\n      "stylePicker": [\n        { "title": "Ljus", "style": "Bakgrund_bke_fk_lj_0484" },\n        { "title": "Mörk", "style": "Bakgrund_bkm_fk_mo_0484",\n          "initialStyle": true,\n          "hasThemeLegend": true,\n            "legendParams": {\n              "legend_options": "dpi:600"\n            }\n        },\n        { "title": "Standard", "defaultWMSServerStyle": true, \n          "legendParams": {\n            "scale": 100\n          } \n        }\n      ]\n```\n## text/html infoFormat for WMS-layers\nWMS servers can usually serve getFeatureInfo requests with a text/html reply. Sometimes they provide customizability of these replies. Then the html returned can have an infinite amount of variation. Origo has basic support for Geoserver WMS layers configured with `infoFormat: text/html`:\n\n if the layer also has the `htmlSeparator` property set to an html tag, like `htmlSeparator: \'ul\'` Origo will try to separate the features from the html reply via the configured tag and present the infoclick hits with a selection that can be traversed via clicking the features in the infowindow or cycling the carousel of the overlay like usual. If no such tag is present for a layer a point will show where the infoclick happened and all feature hits will be presented in one overlay/infowindow (representing the reply from the WMS server as it is). \n\n Because of :milky_way: amount of variation of featureInfo html responses Origo may not be able to separate features with a supplied tag, to this end it is possible to supply Origo with a handler function for the featureInfo html reply. This can be done via the api: `origo.api().getFeatureinfo().addTextHtmlHandler(function)` as well as via a plugin that would define a function and `viewer.getFeatureinfo().addTextHtmlHandler(function)`. \n \n It is advisable to check the default function in src/getfeatureinfo.js to see the form of what is to be returned depending on whether a `htmlSeparator` prop is provided.\n\n Note that the `source` of the [WMS](#wms) layer must have the `type` prop with the `geoserver` value for the `text/html` value of the `infoFormat` property to have the proper effect.\n\n# Styles\n## Style basics\n\nStyles are primarily used to style vector features in Origo but are also used to create layer legends. This means that all layers in Origo should have a style.\n\nStyles are created using [OpenLayers styles](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_Style-Style.html). In OpenLayers styles are created as JavaScript functions but in Origo the creation is simplified and only json syntax is used. All styles must have a name which is used to reference the style from a layer. A simple GeoJson layer example can be seen to the right.\n\nStyles can be compared to building blocks. The smallest building block is a style which can be a fill, stroke, circle, icon or text. These styling blocks can be put together for example to style a polygon layer with a fill, stroke and text style. By combining these blocks more complex styling can be made. Two levels of styling are available where each level is delimited by brackets. The outer level is used to separate styles with filters, see the example [thematic styling](#thematic-styling). The inner level is used to add layers of various styles, see the example [combining styles](#combining-styles). The two levels of brackets must always be provided even if only one fill style is used.\n\nFor more advanced styling it is possible to use a custom style function. This function has to be included in the /src/style/stylefunctions.js. You will still need an usual style/icon for display in the legend. [Example](#custom-style-function)\n\n#### Example defining a layer style\n\n```json\n{\n  "name": "mylayer",\n  "title": "My layer",\n  "source": "data/layer.geojson",\n  "style": "mask",\n  "type": "GEOJSON",\n  "visible": true\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  "styles": {\n    "mask": [\n      [\n        {\n          "stroke": {\n            "color": "rgba(0,0,0,1.0)"\n          },\n          "fill": {\n            "color": "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Fill\n\nA fill style can be defined with the OpenLayers options for a [Fill](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_Fill-Fill.html).\n\n#### Fill example\n\n```json\n{\n  "fill": {\n    "color": "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Stroke\n\nA stroke style can be defined with the OpenLayers options for a [Stroke](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_Stroke-Stroke.html).\n\n#### Stroke example\n\n```json\n{\n  "stroke": {\n    "color": "rgba(0,0,0,1.0)",\n    "width": 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Circle\n\nA circle style can be defined with the OpenLayers options for a [Circle](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_Circle-CircleStyle.html).

Size and src are required.\n\nIcon rotation can be set with `"rotation"`, either by using a fixed value or by specifying an attribute holding rotation values. In the latter case, the attribute name should be enclosed in double curly braces. Rotation values should always be in degrees.\n\n#### Icon example\n\n```json\n{\n  "icon": {\n    "size": [32, 32],\n    "src": "data/png/my_icon.png"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Text\n\nA text style can be defined with the OpenLayers options for a [Text](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_Text-Text.html). The fill option sets the font color and the stroke option is used to create halo effects.\n\nArbitrary text can be provided as text value. For cluster layers the reserved word "size" can be used to show number of features of the cluster.\n\n#### Text example with static text\n\n```json\n{\n  "text": {\n    "font": "Bold 12px Arial",\n    "textAlign": "center",\n    "offsetX": 10,\n    "offsetY": -10,\n    "text": "My label text",\n    "fill": {\n      "color": "rgba(0,0,0,1.0)"\n    },\n    "stroke": {\n      "color": "rgba(255,255,255,0.7)",\n      "width": 2\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example with text from attribute\n\n```json\n{\n  "text": {\n    "font": "14px Arial",\n    "textAlign": "center",\n    "offsetX": 10,\n    "offsetY": -10,\n    "text": "{{name}}",\n    "fill": {\n      "color": "rgba(0,0,0,1.0)"\n    },\n    "stroke": {\n      "color": "rgba(255,255,255,0.7)",\n      "width": 2\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Image\n\nThe image style is not used to style features. It is only used for legend purposes, for example to symbolize a raster layer in the legend. Only the src property is set.\n\n#### Image\n\n```json\n{\n  "image": {\n    "src": "img/png/gra.png"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Legend graphics\n\nMap server legend graphics (WMS only) can be used in the legend. Please note that this will not change the layer style.\n\n#### Legend graphics\n\n```json\n{\n  "icon": {\n    "src": "URL for GetLegendGraphic request (or any other static image asset)"\n  },\n  "extendedLegend": true\n}\n```\n\n### Label\n\nThe label shown for the style in the layermanager/legend when clicking the layer name. If omitted, none is shown.\n\n#### Label\n\n```json\n{\n  "label": "Label for the layer"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Alternative WMS style\n\nOption to pick an alternative layer style for WMS layers. Requires alternative style to be published on map server.\n\n#### Alternative WMS style\n\n```json\n{\n  "icon": {\n    "src": "..."\n  },\n  "wmsStyle": "Name of alternative WMS style"\n}\n```\n\n### Filter\n\nFeatures can be filtered by attributes, enabling [thematic styling](#thematic-styling). Filters can be defined using relational and logical operators. Regular expressions can be used if enclosed in forward slashes.\n\n#### Filter\n\n```json\n"style_example": [\n  [\n    {\n      "icon": {\n      "src": "..."\n      },\n      "filter": "[attributename] == \'Value\'", // basic string comparison\n      "label": "Label shown in legend"\n    }\n  ],\n  [\n    {\n      "icon": {\n      "src": "..."\n      },\n      "filter": "[attributename] === \'/^(?!.*stad$).*/\'",  // using regular expression enclosed in slashes like this /regex/\n      "label": "Label shown in legend"\n    }\n  ],\n  [\n    {\n      "icon": {\n      "src": "..."\n      },\n      "filter": "[attributename] > \'Value\' AND [attributename] !== \'Other value\'", // using relational and logical operator\n      "label": "Label shown in legend"\n    }\n  ]\n]\n\n\n```\n\n### minScale and maxScale\n\nTo use different styles at different zoom levels.\n\n#### minScale and maxScale\n\n```json\n"areas": [\n  [\n    {\n      "maxScale": 12500,\n      "minScale": 100000,\n      "fill": {\n        "color": "rgba(66,89,179,0.4)"\n      },\n      "stroke": {\n        "color": "rgba(60,43,0,0.8)",\n        "width": 1.5\n      },\n      "label": "Style for small scale"\n    }\n  ],\n  [\n    {\n      "minScale": 12499,\n      "fill": {\n        "color": "rgba(66,89,179,0.2)"\n      },\n      "stroke": {\n        "color": "rgba(60,43,0,0.8)",\n        "width": 1.5\n      },\n      "label": "Style for big scale"\n    }\n  ]\n]\n```\n\n### header\n\nThe icon shown in the legend. If true, this symbol will overwrite the default list icon used when having a thematic style. Default is false.\n\n#### header\n\n```json\n"thematic": [\n  [\n    {\n      "fill": {\n        "color": "rgba(0,255,0,0.5)"\n      },\n    \t"stroke": {\n        "color": "rgba(0,255,0,1)",\n        "width": 2\n    \t},\n    \t"filter": "[type] == \'vegetation\'",\n    \t"label": "Vegetation",\n    \t"header": true\n    }\n  ],\n  [\n    {\n      "fill": {\n        "color": "rgba(0,0,255,0.5)"\n      },\n      "stroke": {\n        "color": "rgba(0,0,255,1)",\n        "width": 2\n      },\n      "filter": "[type] == \'water\'",\n      "label": "Water"\n    }\n  ]\n]\n```\n\n### hidden\n\nMakes a style hidden in the legend. Default is false. In this example the "Style for small scale" will not be displayed in the layers legend.\n\n#### hidden\n\n```json\n"areas": [\n  [\n    {\n      "maxScale": 12500,\n      "minScale": 100000,\n      "fill": {\n        "color": "rgba(66,89,179,0.4)"\n      },\n      "stroke": {\n        "color": "rgba(60,43,0,0.8)",\n        "width": 1.5\n      },\n      "label": "Style for small scale",\n      "hidden": true\n    }\n  ],\n  [\n    {\n      "minScale": 12499,\n      "fill": {\n        "color": "rgba(66,89,179,0.2)"\n      },\n      "stroke": {\n        "color": "rgba(60,43,0,0.8)",\n        "width": 1.5\n      },\n      "label": "Style for big scale"\n    }\n  ]\n]\n```\n\n## Style examples\n\nTo get started some common use cases are provided.\n\n### Opacity\n\nColors are defined with rgba values. Opacity is set with the alpha channel, the a part of rgba. In this example the fill is semi-transparent.\n\n#### Opacity\n\n```json\n{\n  "styles": {\n    "simple": [\n      [\n        {\n          "stroke": {\n            "color": "rgba(0,0,0,1.0)"\n          },\n          "fill": {\n            "color": "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Combining styles\n\nDifferent styles can be combined to create complex styles. In this example the features will be styled with two circle styles, one inner circle and one outer circle. The inner circle has the radius 4 and the outer circle the radius 16. Styles are combined by adding styles within the same brackets and are seperated by curly brackets.\n\n#### Combining styles\n\n```json\n{\n  "styles": {\n    "doubleCircle": [\n      [\n        {\n          "circle": {\n            "radius": 16,\n            "stroke": {\n              "color": "rgba(0,0,0,1)",\n              "width": 5\n            },\n            "fill": {\n              "color": "rgba(255,255,255,0.9)"\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          "circle": {\n            "radius": 4,\n            "stroke": {\n              "color": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",\n              "width": 1\n            },\n            "fill": {\n              "color": "rgba(37,129,196,1)"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Thematic styling\n\nBy applying filters thematic styling can be made. In this example features with the attribute type equal to vegetation will be green and features with the attribute type equal to water will be blue. The style settings for each type are grouped by brackets. You are also able to add a label to each filter.\n\n#### Thematic styling\n\n```json\n{\n  "styles": {\n    "thematic": [\n      [\n        {\n          "fill": {\n            "color": "rgba(0,255,0,0.5)"\n          },\n          "stroke": {\n            "color": "rgba(0,255,0,1)",\n            "width": 2\n          },\n          "filter": "[type] == \'vegetation\'",\n          "label": "Vegetation"\n        }\n      ],\n      [\n        {\n          "fill": {\n            "color": "rgba(0,0,255,0.5)"\n          },\n          "stroke": {\n            "color": "rgba(0,0,255,1)",\n            "width": 2\n          },\n          "filter": "[type] == \'water\'",\n          "label": "Water"\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Center point\n\nGeometry calculations can be used to style features. In this example the center point within a polygon is styled with an icon. This is done by adding a geometry property with the value "centerPoint" for the icon style.\n\n#### Center point of polygon\n\n```json\n{\n  "styles": {\n    "center": [\n      [\n        {\n          "stroke": {\n            "color": "rgba(103,60,31,1.0)",\n            "width": 1\n          },\n          "fill": {\n            "color": "rgba(103,60,31,0.1)"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          "icon": {\n            "size": [23, 36],\n            "src": "img/png/droppe.png"\n          },\n          "geometry": "centerPoint"\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Cluster style\n\nWhen creating a style for a cluster layer it is usually desired to show the number of features in each cluster. This can be done be by using the reserved word "size" in which case the number of features will be used as text value. Other text properties are provided as usual.\n\n#### Cluster style with size as text\n\n```json\n{\n  "styles": {\n    "cluster": [\n      [\n        {\n          "circle": {\n            "radius": 16,\n            "fill": {\n              "color": "rgba(103,60,31,0.5)"\n            },\n            "stroke": {\n              "color": "rgba(103,60,31,0.9)",\n              "width": 4\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          "text": {\n            "font": "Bold 12px Arial",\n            "textAlign": "center",\n            "text": "size",\n            "fill": {\n              "color": "rgba(255,255,255,1.0)"\n            },\n            "stroke": {\n              "color": "rgba(103,60,31,0.9",\n              "width": 2\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Custom style function\n\nFor more advanced styling you can use a custom style function and for instance style features depending on multiple attribute values or use more complex filters and styling techniques.\n\n#### Style function included in src/style/stylefunctions.js with a .png-icon for presentation in the legend.\n\n```json\n{\n  "styles": {\n    "basemap": [\n      [\n        {\n          "custom": "basemapStyle",\n          "icon": {\n            "src": "img/png/basemap.png",\n            "size": [20, 20]\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Origo API\n## Using Origo API\n\nOrigo API is a mix of using exposed methods in Origo and objects from OpenLayers.\n\nFor more information on all the options with OpenLayers see [OpenLayers API documentation](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/)\n\nThe examples below should most of them be runnable on Origo demo map that is distributed from the Github repository, but some uses controls or layers that isn\'t specified in configuration.\n\n#### Example code\n\n```javascript\n// The base for calling the Origo API\norigo.api();\n\n// Accessing the OpenLayers API\nOrigo.ol;\n```\n\n### Change visibility of layer\n\nTo change the visibility of a layer first get the layer and then apply setVisible method with true/false as parameter.\n\n#### Example code for making a layer visible\n\n```javascript\norigo.api().getLayer("origo-cities").setVisible(true);\norigo.api().getLayer("origo-cities").setVisible(false);\n```\n\n### Change Zoom\n\nSet the zoom level by enter an integer. The number of zoom level is depending on the configuration and setting a higher number than max zoom will only result in max zoom.\n\n#### Example code for changing zoom\n\n```javascript\norigo.api().getMap().getView().setZoom(8);\n```\n\n### Move the map\n\nTo move the map give the coordinates of the center in the map. If the coordinates is in another projection a function to convert the coordinates to the maps projection can be called.\n\n#### Example code for moving the map\n\n```javascript\n// Set center with the native projection (in this example EPSG:3857) of the map\norigo.api().getMap().getView().setCenter([1985429, 8315145]);\n\n// Set center with transformation of the coordinates from WGS84 to Sweref 99 TM\norigo\n  .api()\n  .getMap()\n  .getView()\n  .setCenter(origo.api().getMapUtils().transformCoordinate([13.5, 59.38], "EPSG:4326", "EPSG:3006"));\n```\n\n### Change visibilty of controls\n\nTo hide or show a control search the control by name and then apply the hide and unhide method on the control.\n\n#### Example code for hide or show a control\n\n```javascript\n// Hide the legend control\norigo.api().getControlByName("legend").hide();\n\n// Show the legend control\norigo.api().getControlByName("legend").unhide();\n```\n\n### Get features\n\nTo get all features from a layer and get all id and names for the features.\n\n#### Example code for getting features and write out their id and names\n\n```javascript\nconst allFeatures = origo.api().getLayer("origo-cities").getSource().getFeatures();\nlet out = "";\nallFeatures.forEach((feature) => {\n  out += `Id: ${feature.getId()} Namn: ${feature.get("name")} \\n`;\n});\nwindow.alert(out);\n```\n\n### Zoom to a feature\n\nTo zoom to a specific feature from a layer.\n\n#### Example code for zooming to a feature\n\n```javascript\norigo.api().zoomToExtent(origo.api().getLayer("origo-cities").getSource().getFeatureById("1").getGeometry());\n```\n\n### Show feature info\n\nTo show the feature info of a feature from a layer.\n\n#### Example code for showing feature info\n\n```javascript\norigo\n  .api()\n  .getFeatureinfo()\n  .showFeatureInfo({\n    feature: origo.api().getLayer("origo-cities").getSource().getFeatureById("2"),\n    layerName: "origo-cities",\n  });\n```\n\n### Place a marker on map\n\nA marker can be placed with coordinates to location and also set a title and text for a popup.\n\n#### Example code for adding a marker with popup on map\n\n```javascript\n// Give coordinates, title for popup and text for popup (HTML allowed)\norigo\n  .api()\n  .addMarker([1926764, 8953470], "Get here!", "<b>Sundsvalls kommun</b><br/>Norrmalmsgatan 4<br/>851 85 Sundsvall");\n```\n\n### Limit features for layer\n\nA filter can be applied to a layer to only show a selection of the features in the layer.\n\n#### Example code for setting a filter on a layer\n\n```javascript\n// Get the layer and then set a filter for it\norigo.api().getLayer("Invasive_species").getSource().setFilter("[OrganismGroup] == \'Mamals\'");\n```\n\n### Get a link for the map\n\nTo get a link of the map with applied layers and settings\n\n#### Example code for creating a sharemap link to the map\n\n```javascript\n// Get the sharemap control and produce a URL and display it in a alert dialog.\norigo\n  .api()\n  .getControlByName("sharemap")\n  .getPermalink()\n  .then((data) => alert(data));\n```\n\n### Get drawn features\n\nTo access the features drawn in the drawplugin lookup the layer called drawplugin and get the features from that layers source.\n\n#### Example code for getting drawn features\n\n```javascript\n// Get all layers\nconst allLayers = origo.api().getMap().getAllLayers();\n\n// Find the layer for draw control and get the source of that layer to get the features.\nallLayers.forEach((layer) => {\n  if (layer.values_.title === "Ritlager") {\n    const drawSource = layer.getSource();\n    const drawnFeatures = drawSource.getFeatures();\n    console.log(drawnFeatures);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Add new tile layer\n\nTo add a new tile layer a source must be given and also a title and name.\n\n#### Example code for adding new layer to map\n\n```javascript\n// Add a StadiaMaps tile layer (requires OpenLayers to be version 8 or higher)\norigo\n  .api()\n  .getMap()\n  .addLayer(\n    new Origo.ol.layer.Tile({\n      source: new Origo.ol.source.StadiaMaps({ layer: "stamen_watercolor" }),\n      title: "Stamen",\n      name: "stamen",\n    })\n  );\n```\n\n### Add new vector layer\n\nTo add a new vector layer from GeoJSON object.\n\n#### Example code for adding new vector layer to map\n\n```javascript\n// Define a GeoJSON object with a point at Stora Torget in Karlstad as coordinates\nvar geojsonObject = {\n  type: "FeatureCollection",\n  crs: {\n    type: "name",\n    properties: {\n      name: "EPSG:3857",\n    },\n  },\n  features: [\n    {\n      type: "Feature",\n      geometry: {\n        type: "Point",\n        coordinates: [1503198, 8263188],\n      },\n      properties: {\n        typ: "En ny punkt!",\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\n// Create a vector source from the GeoJSON object\nvar vectorSource = new Origo.ol.source.Vector({ features: new Origo.ol.format.GeoJSON().readFeatures(geojsonObject) });\n// Create a vector layer\nvar vectorLayer = new Origo.ol.layer.Vector({\n  source: vectorSource,\n  name: "Vektorlager",\n  title: "Vektorlager",\n  queryable: true,\n});\n// Add the layer to the map\norigo.api().getMap().addLayer(vectorLayer);\n\n// Center the map to where geometry was added to the map\norigo.api().getMap().getView().setCenter([1503198, 8263188]);\n\n// Create a circle geometry with the radius 300 m\nvectorSource.addFeature(new Origo.ol.Feature(new Origo.ol.geom.Circle([1503198, 8263188], 300)));\n\n// Clear all features from the vector layer\norigo.api().getLayer("Vektorlager").getSource().clear();\n\n// Add the feature from\norigo.api().getLayer("Vektorlager").getSource().addFeatures(new Origo.ol.format.GeoJSON().readFeatures(geojsonObject));\n```\n\n### Add export to click event\n\nTo do a export on a click event.\n\n#### Example code for adding a click event export method.\n\n```javascript\n// Adds on a click event a method that checks wheter a point feature is clicked on and then makes a GPX export.\norigo\n  .api()\n  .getMap()\n  .on("click", function (e) {\n    this.forEachFeatureAtPixel(e.pixel, function (feature, layer) {\n      if (feature.getGeometry().getType() == "Point") {\n        alert(\n          new Origo.ol.format.GPX().writeFeatures([feature], {\n            dataProjection: "EPSG:4326",\n            featureProjection: "EPSG:3857",\n          })\n        );\n      }\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### Add fetch from API to event\n\nTo do a fetch on a moveend event.\n\n#### Example code for adding a moveend event fetch method.\n\n```javascript\n// Adds on a moveend event a method that fetches height information on center coordinates.\norigo\n  .api()\n  .getMap()\n  .on("moveend", function (e) {\n    var center = origo.api().getMap().getView().getCenter();\n    fetch("https://karta.sundsvall.se/origoserver/lm/elevation/3857/" + center[0] + "/" + center[1])\n      .then((response) => response.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        alert("+" + data.geometry.coordinates[2] + " meter");\n      });\n  });\n```\n\n### Refresh data on a layer\nIf data for a layer changes constantly as for example when fetching temperatures from IoT sensors it can be useful to let the data be refreshed on a regular interval.\n\n#### Example code for refreshing the data for a layer (in this example called \'temperature\') on a regular interval.\n\n```json\n// Refresh temperature data every 10 minutes\nsetInterval(() => {\n  if (origo.api().getLayer(\'temperature\').getVisible()) {\n    origo.api().getLayer(\'temperature\').getSource().refresh();\n  }\n}, 600000);\n```\n\n\n### Add locales\n\nThis might be useful to perform at startup of a map instance in order to add or change translations without altering Origo\'s source files.\n\nIf the id already exists its definition will be overwritten (for the current browser and user, the new definition is saved in local storage). The form must match the current language file form, see definitions in the `loc` folder. Technically it doesn\'t need to be complete though then the missing translations will be looked up in the `fallbackLocaleId` locale if configured. \n\nThe locale language selector, if active in the map menu, will update.\n\n#### Example code showing the definition of the method\n```javascript\n  /**\n * Adds an array of locales to the locales object and stores them in localStorage.\n *\n * @param {Array} locs - An array of locale objects to be added. Defaults to an empty array if not provided.\n * If a locale id matches a current locale then the current locale will be overwritten.\n * @return {boolean} True if locales were added, false otherwise.\n */\n```\n\n#### Example code showing the usage of the method\n```javascript\norigo.api().getControlByName(\'localization\').addLocales([\n  {\n    "id": "en-US",\n    "title": "English",\n    "menuTitle": "Language",\n    "controls": {\n        "measure": {\n            "layerTitle": "Measure result",\n            "mainButtonTooltip": "Measure",\n            "startMeasureTooltip": "Click to start measuring",\n            "lengthTooltip": "Length",\n            "areaTooltip": "Area",\n            "clearTooltip": "Clear",...\n\n        }\n    }\n  }\n])\n```\n\n### Localize a plugin\n\nthe `addPluginToLocale` method is intended as a method for localized plugins to add their translations to the localization control and utilize it to perform their translations. The plugins keep their own language files, one per language, for instance the Barebone plugin might come with a loc/sv_SE.json file.\n\n#### Example code showing a plugin language definition\n```json\n{\n  "barebone": {\n    "mainButtonTooltipText": "Starta maskinen"\n  }\n}\n\n```\nAt init the plugins then needs the viewer object.\n\n#### Example code showning how to init the plugin\n```javascript\norigo.on(\'load\', function(viewer) {\n  const barebone = Barebone({\n    buttonText: \'Click this!\',\n    content: \'Great stuff\',\n    viewer\n });\n```\n\nAfter importing their language file(s) they can receive the viewer object and via it access the `localization` control to add their translations to it.\n\n#### Example code showing how to import language files, receive viewer, acquire localization control and add translations to it\n```javascript\nimport svLocale from \'./loc/sv_SE.json\';\n\nconst Barebone = function Barebone(options = {}) {\n  const {\n    buttonText = \'Default text\',\n    content = \'Default content\',\n    viewer\n  } = options;\n   \n  const localization = viewer.getControlByName(\'localization\');\n  localization.addPluginToLocale(\'sv-SE\', svLocale);\n```\n\nAfter which it can use said control\'s `getStringByKeys` method to perform translations.\n\n#### Example code showing how to perform localization\n```javascript\ntooltipText: localization.getStringByKeys({ targetParentKey: \'barebone\', targetKey: \'tooltipText\' }),\n```\n(numbers can be formatted with a hint of what the currently chosen locale is available via the `getCurrentLocaleId()` method)\n\n#### Example code showing the definition of the method\n```javascript\n  /**\n * Adds an array of locales to the locales object and stores them in localStorage.\n *\n * @param {Array} locs - An array of locale objects to be added. Defaults to an empty array if not provided.\n * If a locale id matches a current locale then the current locale will be overwritten.\n * @return {boolean} True if locales were added, false otherwise.\n */\n```\n\n\n\n'},{}],2:[function(e,t,n){"use strict";t.exports.brandNames={desktop:"Origo documentation",tablet:"Origo docs",mobile:"Origo docs"},t.exports.brandClasses="fill-none
