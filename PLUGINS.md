# Origo plugins
Plugins are to be developed when a feature or function is not appropriate to be included in the origo core. Common reasons are external dependencies or a specific feature or function not requested by the average user. 
## Guidelines development

**[Barebone](https://github.com/origo-map/barebone-plugin)** is an example plugin to provide an initial structure of how you can start developing your plugin. 

Origo core has a lot of dependencies by default which are available to use from the plugins. They should be utilized first before loading more external libraries.

Smaller adjustment to the core might be necessary but should be avoided to make the plugin as standalone as possible.
