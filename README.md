# Origo

An easy to configure framework for creating your own web mapping applications.

## What is Origo?

Origo is a web mapping framework. It is based on the [OpenLayers library](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers). You can use Origo to create your own desktop-like web mapping applications. The project is run and maintained by a number of Swedish municipalities.

## Features

 * Responsive design
 * Multiple modules available (among others: an editing interface, geopositioning and map sharing)
 * Ability to read data from multiple different types of sources
 * Very light footprint

## How to get started

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/origo-map/origo/releases/) and check out the [documentation](https://origo-map.github.io/origo-documentation/latest/#origo-api). Below you will find some live examples and how to get started devoloping with Origo.

## Getting started
So you have decided to take matters into your own hands and get coding? Great!

Just follow these three steps and you will be up and running in no time.

### Setting up the development environment
The minimum requirements are:

  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 10 or higher is recommended to avoid build problems)

 1. To get your own local copy of Origo use git to clone the repository with the command below:

   		  git clone https://github.com/origo-map/origo.git

 2. To install the required node dependencies run the following command from the root directory of Origo:

  		   npm install

 3. To start webpack-dev-server use:

   		  npm start

The server will be available at <http://localhost:9966/>. It utilizes LiveReload which means you do not have to refresh the browser page whenever you make a change in your code.

### Creating a bundle
Once you are ready to create a minified bundle, you will use:

     npm run build

This will create a build of Origo in the build folder. Note that you will need to change the path to the Origo javascript file in the `index.html` file, from `origo.js` to `origo.min.js`, if you wish to run the map using the bundled version.

To further reduce the bundle size of Origo it's recommended to enable gzip on your web server, as in this example for [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/httpcompression/). This will reduce the file size to approximately a fourth of the original size.

### Notes
Guidelines for developing in Origo are available in the [`DEVELOPING.md`](https://github.com/origo-map/origo/blob/master/DEVELOPING.md) file.

## Plugins
More information about Origo plugins can be found in the [PLUGINS.md](https://github.com/origo-map/origo/blob/master/PLUGINS.md) file.
